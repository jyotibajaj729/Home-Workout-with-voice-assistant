# Home-Workout-with-voice-assistant
In this project, we present a tool for body recognition and repetition counting for different exercises. Our counting method was based on recognizing the exercises and analyzing the body angles required for that exercise. If the angles measured are correct count of repetitions will increase. This approach is straightforward and requires pre trained model of mediapipe and we have shown it works fine. Users will also be to know the amount of calories they burnt while doing the specific exercise. Users will also be able to analyze their performance by checking their previous record from the accessible csv file stored after every session.
